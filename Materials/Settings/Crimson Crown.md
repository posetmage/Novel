# Act I
The_Setup:
  "In the bustling city of Eldoria, a melting pot of races and cultures, rumors spread of a warlord seeking the Crimson Crown, said to grant its wearer control over dragons.

  "Introduce our adventurers: a bold human knight with a quest for glory, a cunning elven rogue searching for her family's redemption, a wise dwarven wizard bearing ancient knowledge, and a mysterious tiefling cleric guided by prophetic visions. Each has a reason to seek the crown, yet their true journey lies beyond their initial desires."
